The client was done in Reast js, while orchestrator in java.
Strength: responsive GUI, loosely coupled, user authentification, good error-handling, caching is done with handling updates: daily for weather, monthly for crime, making every effort to handle and overcome external services downtime without user knowing it( deleting old data in weather and showing what is remaining, until finished); retrieving data from external services is done ensuring timeouts are handled â€“ retry 3 times to get data with 500ms sleep. All communication is done in Json with needed serialisation and deserialization. Docker file was created for orchestrator and can be started. Orchestrator is deployed to the cloud.
